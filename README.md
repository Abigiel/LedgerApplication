# LedgerApplication
## Introduction
The LedgerApplication is a program that enables the user to keep track of all transactions in an organized way. It gives options to add a deposit or payment to the transactions list. It also gives several display options dependending on what the user needs.

## Display Screens

### Home Screen

The first screen displayed is the home screen. The options are provided as follows.

One of the following screens are displayed according to the users choice.

If the user goes on to select Display Ledger from here the user will have more options as displayed.

This screen is where the user veiws the transactions after choosing which transactions they would like to see.

#### For All:

#### For Deposits:

#### For Payments:

![LedgerScreenPayments](https://github.com/Abigiel/LedgerApplication/assets/120342005/1bb7825e-e0e1-45c1-ae05-c3a45fcd17bc)

If the user selects Reports from here the user will have more options as displayed as in the screen below.

The outputs from these options are the following displays.

![ReportsDisplay1-3](https://github.com/Abigiel/LedgerApplication/assets/120342005/ace6425f-b054-48f8-bc4d-937f266c96be)

![ReportsDisplay4-0](https://github.com/Abigiel/LedgerApplication/assets/120342005/9eb2b5b2-8609-46cd-bab2-e585fe54345f)


A section of code that I found interesting is the method I used to sort the displays by date and time. I used a lambda expression to compare dates and wrapped that in a method so it can be used in both classes that it was needed.

Overall, this exercise has shown me that practicing the concepts we learn in class is probably the most important part of learning programming languages. The process of figuring out your version of what works through researching and trial and error is both frustrating and fun.
